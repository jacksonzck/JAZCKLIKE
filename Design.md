# JAZCKLIKE design document

## Goal of the Project

 The goal of JAZCKLIKE is to provide a *generalized* *extensible* framework for user-created "Zachlike" puzzles, including many of the components from the games featured in the Zachtronics catalogue.

## User Stories

 - A player pulls in a puzzle they want and can play it and view the score. 
 - A puzzle maker can make the puzzle with the components they use, input and output criteria, and custom? scoring metrics.
